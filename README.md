# Multi Thread Demo
-----------------------------

A small piece of code to demonstrate knowledge of threads in the C programming language. For COS350 - Systems Programming at USM

The main idea is to have 4 threads in total. 2 threads are responsible for making a random mathematical expression and adding them to a shared memory buffer.
2 other threads are dedicated to taking the mathematical expressions and solving them, then printing the result.
